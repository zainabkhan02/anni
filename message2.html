        <h2>Favourite Picture?</h2>
        <p>
            Are you ever in a moment and think damm i'm really gonna miss this. This is one of those. But 
            breaking news: you can't physically relive a memory, you can only long for it. Yeaaa this news 
            breaks me. Anywayyyy If you don't already know, this is my fav picture of us, I am absolutely
            in love with your smile. I love everything about you, your eyes, your biceps (yes, those are 
            mine too), your hands, and of course, your smile... which I think I love just a little more 
            than everything else. I remember listening to songs where the lyrics were all about someone's
            smile, and I would wonder, "Could I ever love someone enough to feel this way?" Well, I think
            I have my answer now. Like cmonn would you look at that
            smile? I haven't yet gotten a picture, or a smile, like that from you again, but until that 
            moment comes, this one will always be my most treasured possession. Back then, I didn't fully
             understand just how much I would miss these moments, but at least, I know I can always 
             relive them in my memories and fall for you all over again.
