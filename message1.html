        <h2>First Date?</h2>
        <p>
            I still remember the rush, hurrying from my water sports place, eager to reach home, get dressed, and meet you. I drove so fast, laughing to myself... it's silly, but somehow, it felt so right. I don't know why I did what I did, I just trusted my heart.  And somehow, that trust led me straight to you.

            I'm not sure if it was even a date, or if it was truly romantic, but I will always hold this day in my heart. The first picture we took, you buying me that chocolate, the way we danced under the sky, me being your passenger princess for the very first time. My first ever beer, us on the beach, sharing a piece of chocolate. Our "first" kiss, and of course, the sunrise with you.. just us, the world still asleep (including Aastha lol).

            I didn't know what was ahead of us, was it just one of those “whatever happens in Goa stays in Goa” moments, or was it something much more? I found the answer over time. The stars just aligned perfectly for us to meet, and after that, it was up to us to write our story. And I think we are doing good haina baby? Thank God I trusted my heart, because everything else just fell into place.
