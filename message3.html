        <h2>Future Life?</h2>
        <p>
            "Future Life?" That's exactly what I think of every time I look at this picture. Us, 
            living together, in our comfy clothes, right next to each other. Can you even imagine it?
            Next to each other?? When I can get a kiss anytime I want. The thought of sharing the most
            ordinary moments with you like sitting on the couch while we work, picking up groceries, 
            making coffee for each other, sundays, going for walks, doing laundry, taking care of one 
            another, teasing each other, just domestice sweetness, buying home decor together, making 
            traditions, cooking dinner while singing along to the songs in the background, making each 
            other breakfasts in bed, leaving notes around the house for each other... 
            god it gives me butterflies even imagining, it just makes my heart feel so full.
            This photo, and the brief time that you spent here in Bangalore, gives me a glimpse of a 
            life we could have together. I can't wait to build that life with you, baby.
