        <h2>One Year?</h2>
        <p>
           I could say I can't believe it's been a year already, but I do believe it because I believe 
           in us. This past year has been nothing short of comforting, having you, even if it's just a 
           call, has always made me feel like I have someone to come home to. To have someone whom I can
           love with my entirety, and someone I can imagine spending my life with ahhhh. I will never 
            get over the fact that we can love people despite there being countries between us, we can 
            miss people we've barely seen in person, we can connect and bond over hundreds of things 
            without ever needing to be in each others physical presence, we can have half the globe 
            between us and still love wont falter.  It's beautiful actually, now that I have experienced 
            this myself. Although now, I would love to experience being next to you quite honestly. 
            But yeaa someday we will have our own place and my world won't be confined to my room. I will roll over and find you sleeping next to me, I will stumble sleepily through the house in the morning, opening the blinds, we will sit out in the backyard, stare at the stars, go to bed together after a long day. One day we will have all of this and we will survive long enough to have it. Until then, I have
           you and you have me. It's okay if I have to spend a few years with distance between us. I will wait, to bury
           my head in the crook of your neck, to lock my fingers with yours, to run my hands through your hair, to give you 
           the tightest hug, to lay my hand on your chest and look into your eyes. To love you, with everything I have got.
           Okay baby let me see if this will even fit in the box haha so I will stop writing even though I can literally write a book right now.
           I love you baby and that makes me the happiest, perhaps nothing else on earth matters, besides the love you take in and the love you put out. 
           Happppyyyy Oneeee Yeaarrrrr, as long as I'm here, you will always have someone who is proud of you in everything. Love you, mean it.
