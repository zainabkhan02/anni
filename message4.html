        <h2>Memories?</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes it breaks my heart when I realize that we're apart during the important moments we 
            should be sharing together. Yet, even in that distance, we've created memories that means 
            everything to me.
            Like the surprise flowers you sent when I was feeling low, or the surprise 
            you planned for my birthday, I will never truly forget how special I felt. And look at me  
            revisiting my web development days just to create something special for you, this, this right
            here is my love language, I used to feel long distance would be impossible for me because I wont
            be able to express my love or feel loved and then what's the point but love really is just "I'm thinking
            of you. I will ask you if you are okay. I remember how you smell. I want to talk to you. I hope your family is well.
            I will read to you, I will write for you. I like your laugh. I like making you laugh. I will sit next to you. I got 
            you your favourite food, I made it for you. Your eyes are beautiful. I think you'd like this. This song
            reminds me of you. I miss you I wish you were here." isn't it ??
            It will all be worth it baby. The kisses through the phone, the longing for each other... all of it 
            brings me closer to you. I truly believe that distance makes the heart grow fonder. I don't 
            mind the miles between us, the busy days, the tears when I realllyyy miss you. I don't 
            mind being apart on the special days that we should share, as long as we're together. I will hold onto the hope of being next to you for now.
             One day, all of this will make sense, and we'll look back knowing it 
            was all worth it. Like I said I would choose this long-distance  in a heartbeat. I would 
            choose it a thousand times over, just to have the chance to meet you, to know you, and to
            love you with all my heart.
